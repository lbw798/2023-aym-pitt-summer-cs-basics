## Purpose
In an attempt to teach python basics comprising of Strings, Integers, Booleans, Lists, Functions, Modules, OOPy (Object Oriented Programming), and Control Flow to middle schoolers, [this typing game](https://pythonturtle.academy/typing-game-with-python-and-turtle-source-code-included/) has been broken apart in order to do a walkthrough codealong demonstration. During the codealong, basic topics will be covered as they come up. The game uses python and the [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) module

## Files
- main.py: where the codealong will take place
- admin/source.py: a basic complete version of the game
- admin/customized_game.py: a customized version of the game with a combination of the summer camp space theme and a joke with the turtle module that's used for demo
- copy_file(1,2,3).py: chunks of code that is either tedious to write or deemed too difficult to cover in the time alotted in which students will just copy and paste in when the time comes during the code along

## How to Use
Step 1: git clone and get to typing
